 Natural Tiny Shell (NT-Shell) is a tiny shell for a small
 embedded system.

1. Special thanks

 Mr.Paul Williams
 - He created a draw of DEC compatible state machine parser.
 Mr.Joshua Haberman
 - He implemented the state machine parser with C language.
   And it has great interface. It's really simple and smart!

2. The background

 Today, There are so many great MPUs.
 And the developper can design a small embedded system with it.
 It's really great things and I never imagine 20 years ago.

 There is a way to debug a embedded system using UART interface.
 It is same as UNIX terminal interfaces.

 The developper can be control a embedded system with it.

3. The basic concepts

 * Small :)
 * Simple :)
 * Compatible with VT100 :)
 * No need any C runtime library :)

4. Features

 CTRL+A : Head
 CTRL+E : Tail
 CTRL+F : Cursor right
 CTRL+B : Cursor left
 CTRL+C : Cancel
 CTRL+P : History(Prev)
 CTRL+N : History(Next)

5. The structure

 NT-Shell are consists from 5 modules.

 * Top interface module
    ntshell.c
    ntshell.h
 * Utility
    ntopt.c
    ntopt.h
    ntlibc.c
    ntlibc.h
 * VT100 parser
    vtparse.c
    vtparse.h
    vtparse_table.c
    vtparse_table.h
 * Text editor
    text_editor.c
    text_editor.h
 * Text history
    text_history.c
    text_history.h

6. Porting guide

 The NT-Shell interface is really simple.
 It need 2 I/O interfaces for UART and a callback interface
 for getting a user request.

 void ntshell(
        vtparse_t *parser,
        text_editor_t *editor,
        text_history_t *history,
        int (*func_read)(void *buf, int cnt),
        int (*func_write)(const void *buf, int cnt),
        int (*func_cb)(const unsigned char *text));

 6-1. func_read

  func_read is a interface for reading user key inputs.
  It's blocking interface.

 6-2. func_write

  func_write is a interface for writing shell outputs.
  It's blocking interface.

 6-3. func_cb

  func_cb is a callback interface for user request to your system.

7. The license

 * vtparse and vtparse_table is in the public domain.
 * ntshell, text_editor, text_history is in the MIT license.
